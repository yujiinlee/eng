# Overview

* Period: 2023.02 ~ 2023.12
* Coworker: 1 Designer, 5 Developers
* Platform: Web
 
<b>Catalog is a system that meta-datafies the unique attributes of commerce products, ensuring consistent management. </b> Its goal is to enhance customers' product discovery/exploration experience, contributing to increased sales, and eliminating redundant resource management for products across services.

As a solo designer, I took charge of both the design of 'attribute management' feature and 'catalog items'. I collaborated with the PM to create the most suitable screen layout and flow, and oversaw the development implementation and design QA.

# 01. Problem

Previously, each seller entered their own product names, resulting in different data even for the same product. Additionally, essential attributes such as brand and capacity were not managed as data, making it impossible to search using this information. With the expansion of e-commerce services to three or more, and the influx of multiple sellers, the necessity for integrated product management has become apparent.

# 02. Goal

To address the above issues, we established the following three goals:

* Making it possible to assign and manage various attributes to products.
* Creating 'catalog items' that serve as the data reference for other products.
* Allowing sellers to import information from 'catalog items' to compose product details.

# 03. Design Strategies

### 1) Easy-to-use

The people who use the catalog are likely to be outsourced employees with a high turnover rate among personnel, I prioritized creating an intuitive user interface and flow that even first-time users could easily understand.

When adding attributes or items, we had to carry out multiple actions such as product search, selection, addition, and confirmation/deletion of added products within a single modal. To ensure users do not feel overwhelmed, we designed the layout to follow a flow from top to bottom and from left to right, aligning with the natural direction of the user's gaze.

Additionally, since many buttons coexist on one screen, we differentiated the hierarchy of buttons using colors and utilized the disabled state to indicate which button should be pressed first, ensuring clarity for users.

### 2) Prevent mistakes

Due to the extensive impact it has on the entire range of products, any incorrect modifications or deletions in the catalog system could result in critical issues. Therefore, I designed the system with careful attention to restricting input for values that cannot be entered and implementing a confirmation process through pop-ups to mitigate potential risks.

### 3) Minimize time and effort

Entering attributes and product information from scratch every time is very cumbersome and time-consuming. For efficiency, we made it easy to retrieve existing attributes and product information, aallowing for quick registration with just minor modifications.
